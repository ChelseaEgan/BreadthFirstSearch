This program was created for the Analysis of Algorithms course at Oregon State University.

It implements a breadth-first search to etermines whether it is possible to designate wrestlers from an input file as either Babyfaces or Heels such that each rivalry is between a Babyface and a Heel. If possible, it prints the list of each.
